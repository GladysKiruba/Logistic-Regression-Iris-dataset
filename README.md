# Logistic-Regression-Iris-dataset
If there are two classes, it classifies the target variable into either of two classes. Mostly it is classified into  binary 1 or binary 0. It is used in spam detection, cancer detection, probability of getting insurance etc.

**Types of Logistic Regression:**

Based on the number of classes it classifies, it is divided into 
Binary 
Multinomial 
Ordinal

**Binary:**

Here there are only two classes and the logistic regression classifies into binary 1 or binary 0. For example yes or no, fail or pass, true or false etc

**Multinomial:**

If there are more than two classes like ‘Group A’, ’Group B’ and  ‘Group C’ to be classified and the order doesn’t matters then it comes under multinomial classification. 

**Ordinal:**

If there are more than two classes to be classified and the order matters then it comes under ordinal classification. For example poor, good, excellent etc

**Binary Logistic Regression:**

The sigmoid curve is given by
Z=1/(1+e-Z)
e= Euler’s number=2.71828
The sigmoid function Z converts the input into range 0 and 1. So when the output is greater than 0.5 it is ‘yes’ and when it is less than 0.5 it is ‘no’.
